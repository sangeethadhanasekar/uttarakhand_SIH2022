## Abstract:
Uttarakhand is a state with 13 districts, and this portal depicts famous local things of every district of Uttarakhand. The heritage of Uttarakhand is the portal where you can find all those basic information like dynamic weather update, crops, Famous places of land, Flavours of land, Famous Handicrafts that is, top 3 famous local things of particular districts which are given as static info(in our basic model website). This site uplifts the lifestyle of the cottage business people because they can advertise their handicrafts by adding their products in our portal as Admin. Adding review system may results in clashing between two  vendor’s products, which further affect their interest on cottage industry in turn affects their livelihood, and make a change in economy of the state. so, we decided not to include that in the vendor portal. “Appreciation can make a day, even change a life. Your willingness to put it into words is all that is necessary.” — as quoted by Margaret Cousins, if any users want to share their views over handicrafts, they can contact them in personal by email or phone numbers as given in web portal. And our feature plan is to add Login/Register page to both the Vendor and Tourist domain for easy and effective maintenance of user’s data. If User choose vendor domain, they can add their product image and price to advertise their product. If user choose Tourist’s domain, they can add image of the famous place which they have experienced and we also offer tour packages to users by allowing interested third party trip organizers. In future, We will add a database to identify each and every famous local things of particular villages. And this portal will be deployed after completion.
